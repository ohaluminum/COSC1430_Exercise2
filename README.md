# COSC1430_Exercise2

Given the Shape2D class (see the provided Shape2D.h), implement a derived class, named Rectangle with the following additional members:

    Two private member variables, width and height (both are float)
    
    The corresponding accessors and mutators to access and modify the above two private member variables:
    
      float getWidth();
      float getHeight();
      void setWidth(float );
      void setHeight(float );

    A public function to compute and the area of a rectangle and set the area to the variable area inherited from Shape2D:

      void compArea();

Implement the above Rectangle class correctly to pass the unit tests. 

Also, please fix the provided main() function so that it can compile and run properly.
